What has been completed:
- Created the board
- Created the pieces of both sides
- On the board there are letters and numbers along the axis to show which tile you are on
- Created correct piece movement algorithms for each piece
- Created taking opponents pieces
- Created pawn promotion to queen
- Implemented the Check rule
- If in check, it is stated at the top of the screen
- Implemented turns
- Following from turns, the turn of the current player is displayed at the top
- Stopped pieces from leaving the board
- Centered each piece in the middle of their current tile
- Started to develop the basis for breaking check
- King is unable to put itself into check

- Main menu framework has been completed and merged with the game, more features to be added

What is yet to be completed:
- Checkmate
- Following Checkmate is a winner and the congratulations that follows
- Stalemate
- Castling
- En passante
- Improved gui to see the moves you can make each time you click a piece
- When in check you have to break the check before the next move
- Stop pieces other than king from moving if it will result in checking yourself

Current bugs/issues:
- The space the king is on can be moved to but the king remains and the other 'taking' piece is not affects, this will be fixed when
  checkmate, stalemate and the check rules are completed. It will no longer be a problem because the 'taking' or attacking piece
  will not be able to move onto the kings tile before the game ends
