How to run our chess game:
if you have not already got these installed
- Download python3, the earlier versions run faster.
- Download pygame ensure it's up to date
- Download vscode or another ide that supports python and pygame
- Install a python debugger

- If cloned into onedrive the pathing does not work correctly

  Finally run the main.py with all components in the same folder
